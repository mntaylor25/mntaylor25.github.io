# About Me
## My Interests
In my spare time I enjoy putting together puzzles. I also enjoy cooking and baking for my family. One of my guilty pleasures is watching the 'Real Housewives' series on Bravo.

## Websites I Recommend
• [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com)
 >◦Scribd is a digital document library that contains millions of documents in almost every subject you can think of. I love that I can find information about whatever I am researching. Scribd is also partners with Everand, which gives you access to ebooks, audio books, and podcasts.
 
•[Trailhead](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/)|
>◦ Trailhead is Salesforce's free online training program. Prior to coming to WTCC, I was using Trailhead to gain skills in order to obtain my Salesforce Administrator Certificate. I love that it breaks down _Trails_, or modules, by certification type and gives users real-life scenarios to learn from.
